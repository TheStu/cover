Playing around with Rails in API mode / React.

The idea is to use Amazon's embedded 'preview kindle ebook' feature to let readers decide if they like a book by reading the sample of the book. Readers can then see the book on Amazon, get another book similar to the one they're reading or get something different. Books are fetched via the Amazon Product API.
